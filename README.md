# 🔐 WeTransfer Login Page Replica

A responsive **frontend-only** clone of the WeTransfer login system, including **Login**, **Register**, and **Forgot Password** forms — all with SweetAlert2 modals for user feedback. This project simulates the user interface of an authentication system, without any backend.
